# healthkit-data-parser

Special thanks to this [guy][1] for his boilerplate [code][2] on reading xml. 

This script uses regex for parsing the 'startDate' attribute. Please feel free to add more regex patterns that suit your datetime format! :)

### Prerequisite:

Make sure you extract your iPhone's Healthkit data and save the _export.xml_ in the same folder as the parse.py script.

### How to extract your iPhone Healthkit data:

1. In the Health app, go to Health Data (the binder with the heart on it)
2. Click the box with the outwards arrow (top right)
3. It will give you the option to export the data by emailing a .zip file.
